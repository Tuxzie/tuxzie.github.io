# Preface:
  Over the past few months of summer [June & July 2025], I dug intensely into the rabbithole of home labbing. First, it started because I wanted to dual-boot Cinnamon (Linux Mint) on my desktop, 
but soon evolved into hours of dedicated forum reading. Thank god people walked so I could sprint.

## My experience with Linux Mint, Ubuntu (Desktop & Server), and Arch Linux:
  Starting with Mint. I absolutely love the speed of Cinnamon & XFCE compared to Windows 11. The developers of Mint deserve praise for their work. While I should have used Linux 
Journey's Grasshopper for learning, I seem to prefer the trial-and-error method of getting stuck and digging into Linux-Mint and reddit forums. Sometimes the fix was to use 
the terminal, other times it was because I downloaded an incompatible file system and/or dependencies. 

  Ubuntu Desktop was no different from Linux Mint except for being marginally slower and having a different format. I believe I have acclimated to Mint, so I have a preference
bias but regardless, both are very good OS for beginners such as I was.

  After quickly adapting to learning how the terminal worked, thanks to forum digging & Linux Journey, I wanted to check out why the internet seemed to have an obsession with
Arch Linux as an OS. So I downloaded Arch Linux's image, verified the image (which took much longer than I'd like to admit), and put it onto VMWare. I struggled immensely as
I only had at most a few days or a week on the Debian OS I had used (Linux Mint/Ubuntu). I happened to get it working, but only after being so deeply frustrated and taking a
few breaks due to my low knowledge of OS in general. When I finally got Arch Linux configured, I then realized I had to port in a boot installer such as GRUB. Afterwards,
I found myself happy with the learning and amicably stepped away from Arch Linux... knowing using that it was just short of an OS appealing to sunk-cost fallacy in terms of time.

## What did I learn:
### Linux Mint & Ubuntu
    o How to bash script
      -Make/change directories, folders, files, and configure permissions/ownership
      -Download via bash, check for updates, and update via terminal
      -How to download & configure All-In-One Linux OS 
      -Understand and respect dependencies, file types, and system requirements (x86, x64, ARM, .deb, etc.)
      -Configure a firewall using Uncomplicated Firewall [aka UFW]
    o Adapting Windows processes to Linux
      -Finding & downloading alternatives to apps only available on Windows [using GitHub & Linux community repos, etc.]
      -Using curl, software manager [sometimes], and downloading even more dependencies 

### Arch Linux
      o No (I'm kidding)
      o Configuring an OS with more control
        -Recognizing & respecting the role of GRUB and the work of OS builders
        -Better understanding Bash's capabilities as a script
        -Downloading literally anything is a nightmare
